## Problem Statement
The media streaming service needs to manage a large amount of data related to songs,
podcasts, artists, record labels, hosts, and episodes. The service generates monthly payments
based on royalties collected from song play counts and podcast advertisements.
The royalties are paid out to record labels and artists, while podcast hosts are paid
a flat fee and bonus. The service needs to keep track of all payment information and
generate reports on various aspects of the streamed items and associated parties, including
monthly and yearly summaries of payments, subscribers, play count, and ratings.
The challenge is to design a database system that can efficiently store and manage all
this information, provide easy access for analysis, and ensure data integrity and security.
